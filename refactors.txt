1. Improve construction of reservation and room classes in hotel booker. I'm not sure the Factory is the best option.
2. Consider the difference between booking a hotel block and reserving a room within that block. At the moment, booking the hotel block counts as reserving all the rooms.
3. Revisit the use of "Hotel::HotelBooker.new.find_room(@room_number)" to create a new instance of HotelBooker to use the find_room method. There might be a better way to find the instance of room in this situation that's less weird.
